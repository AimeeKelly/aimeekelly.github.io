                            <p>In the morning we had an introduction to the company. We played a game as well as having 
                                a tour of the building. I was given my own office desk and computer to use for the week. </p>
                            <p>The first workshop we were given was on logo design. We had to think of ideas for a gamesroom logo.
                                Using a software called Inkscape we then made the logo digitaly.
                            </p>
                            <p> We were them given a workshop in the terminal and Git. We set up reporitories and get a GitHub account.
                                We learned many commands in the terminal such as:
                            <pre>cd</pre>
                            <pre>cat</pre>

                                In the morning we srarted to make a blog using HTML in VScode editor. I edited it to make it 
                                my own. we leaned how to change images, text, links and add pages.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                At 10:30 we got a talk from Owen on Trello. Trello is a website that lets you be more orginised
                                in work and what you need to do. I added all my activities into different sections on the page.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After break we had a microbit workshop. I already knew a lot about microbit as I used it in my Junior
                                Cert. This was great fun and I made many programmes such as a dice generator, compass and daylight sensor.
                                This was another great day at Red Hat.

                                In the morning we got some talks about people lives and how you can be in different paths
                                but still end up where you want to be. Dominik and Christian went first followed by Kellie after.
                                The message of all the talks was to not give up on your dreams and I thought it was very insporational.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                               Later we had a big discussion in the conference room by Rachel about college and software engineering.
                               It was very informative and I feel like I know more about what to look into in the future.
                            </p>
                            <p>At the end of the day we were split up into groups and we had a bridge building challenge. We came up with
                                 a design that uses a lot of triangles for support. We had popsticle sticks, pipe cleaners and sellotape to 
                                 work with. In the end we wrapped the whole thing in sellotape because it was too weak. We placed second overall.
                                 I am pretty happy with that.

                                In the morning we had an big meeting with eveyone in the office. They spoke about plans and work in the future.
                                I had to give an introduction to everyone. There was a raffel and I won a benie. After that there was a hot breakfast 
                                in the canteen and I had a crossaint. I really enjoyed the morning.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In the afternoon we got two talks. The first was about working in RedHat as a diractor of a branch. It was really interesting
                                 and I learned more about what are the tasks and jobs people have here. The next talk was about RHIVOS which is a new branch 
                                 in RedHat that are working on making cars more technological. It was really interesting.
                            </p>
                                The rest of the day we did some coding which I was very happy about as I enjoy it a lot. We did some java in prossesing, a coding
                                software. I edited a bounce a ball game in python and made it my own. I fixed the paddle, changed the colours and added a pause button.
                                I enjoyed using python to make games again.
                            </p>
                            <p>
